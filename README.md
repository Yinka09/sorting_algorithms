# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are fundamental algorithms in computer science used
to arrange elements in a specific order, such as numerical or alphabetical.
Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort,
Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, among others.
